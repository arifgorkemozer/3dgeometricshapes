# 3dgeometricshapes
Vertex, color and triangle generation for objects in 3d space.

# What is this about?

These scripts generates 3d shapes such as
    - pyramid (pyramid_maker.py)
    - comet (star_maker.py)
    - cone (cone_maker.py)
    - rectangular parallelpiped (box_maker.py)


by generating vertices in 3d space. In addition, these scripts also generate triangles from these vertices. Each vertex of a triangle has a color associated with it. To understand what these scripts generate as a model, visuals are added in the repository.

# How to run?

If you run scripts without an argument, they will fail and write a message that states arguments needed. However, it is better to show them here aswell:
